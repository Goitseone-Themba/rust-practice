## Keypoints

### Declaration
Use the keyword let to declare variables

`   let x = 5;
    let name = "Themba";
`

### Mutability
Variables are immutable by default, use the keyword 'mut' to make them mutable.

`   let x = 5;

    x = 6;      //Cannot reassign immutable variable x
`

`   let mut x = 5;

    x = 6;
`
